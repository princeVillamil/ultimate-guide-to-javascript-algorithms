Imperative Vs Declarative
% Very often, we find these term thrown around like they are very simple concepts everyone should know. However, the difference is usually not much obvious to most.
## Imerative - how things should be done
Is a style of programming is one which specifies how things get done. Imperative = you are specifying how things get done

## Declarative - what should be done
Declarative approach would abstract this process, allowing you to specify what should be done rather than how. Thus you may use the .reduce() method on the array to reduce every element to a final value by returning the sum within the call back
